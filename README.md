  Polycode
</h1>

**Polycode** is an independent [Grok Build](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build)
fork developing **Grok, ChatGPT subscription, and experimental Cursor subscription
selection in the same TUI**, while retaining Grok's native agent engine, tools,
MCP, permissions, sessions, and features. It is not an official xAI, OpenAI,
or Cursor release.

**The v0.2.0 Windows installation recommendation is withdrawn.**
The published [v0.2.0 prerelease](https://github.com/Miku0139oao/Polycode/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
launches through WSL and has user-reported failures across Grok, ChatGPT and Cursor.
Do not treat it as a working Windows-native release. A Windows-native replacement
is under validation in [PR #1](https://github.com/Miku0139oao/Polycode/pull/1);
real-provider and clean-Windows acceptance is not complete.

**Upstream Grok Build** is SpaceXAI's terminal-based AI coding agent. It runs as a
full-screen TUI that understands your codebase, edits files, executes shell
commands, searches the web, and manages long-running tasks — interactively,
headlessly for scripting/CI, or embedded in editors via the Agent Client
Protocol (ACP).

![Upstream Grok Build TUI; not evidence of native subscription integration](https://media.x.ai/v1/website/universe-tui-screenshot-6f7a0837.png)

**Learn more about Grok Build at [x.ai/cli](https://x.ai/cli)**

The upstream Rust CLI/TUI and agent runtime originate in the SpaceXAI monorepo.
`SOURCE_REV` records the imported upstream revision, not this fork's native

## Installation status

**There is currently no supported public Windows installation command.**
The previous one-command installer selects the historical WSL-based v0.2.0
candidate. Its Windows installation recommendation is withdrawn because that
package requires WSL and users have reported failures with every provider.

Windows-native Polycode is the replacement target: a Windows x64 executable
and Windows runtime, with no WSL requirement. The candidate is being validated
in [PR #1](https://github.com/Miku0139oao/Polycode/pull/1). Local build or mock-test
success does not establish real login, generation, or clean-Windows acceptance.
An install command will be restored after the replacement is accepted.

Existing v0.2.0 assets and older integration documents are historical development
material, not a current installation recommendation. See the
[known issues in the v0.2.0 release notes](https://github.com/Miku0139oao/Polycode/releases/tag/v0.2.0).

## Building from source

Requirements:

- **Rust** — the toolchain is pinned by [`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml);
  `rustup` installs it automatically on first build.
- **[DotSlash](https://dotslash-cli.com)** — required so hermetic tools under
  [`bin/`](bin/) (notably [`bin/protoc`](bin/protoc)) can download and run.
  Install it and ensure `dotslash` is on your `PATH` **before** building:

  ```sh
  cargo install dotslash
  # or: prebuilt packages — https://dotslash-cli.com/docs/installation/
  /usr/bin/env dotslash --help   # sanity check
  ```

- **protoc** — proto codegen resolves [`bin/protoc`](bin/protoc) via DotSlash,
  or falls back to a `protoc` on `PATH` / `$PROTOC`.
- For this fork, use the target WSL Arch x64 environment above. Upstream supports
  additional build hosts, but those are not verified Polycode release targets.

```sh
cargo run -p xai-grok-pager-bin              # build + launch the TUI
cargo build -p xai-grok-pager-bin --release  # release binary: target/release/xai-grok-pager
cargo check -p xai-grok-pager-bin            # fast validation
```

The binary artifact is named `xai-grok-pager`; upstream installs ship it as
`grok`. These Cargo commands alone do not initialize Polycode's native provider
service. The integrated launcher/build path is described in
[integrations/README.md](integrations/README.md); do not use an older ACP binary
as a native integration build. The upstream
[authentication guide](crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/docs/user-guide/02-authentication.md)
describes Grok authentication, not proof of subscription OAuth support.

## Documentation

Upstream Grok Build documentation is available at
[docs.x.ai/build/overview](https://docs.x.ai/build/overview). For this fork's
subscription integration status, use [integrations/README.md](integrations/README.md).

The user guide ships with the pager crate:
[`crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/docs/user-guide/`](crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/docs/user-guide/)
— getting started, keyboard shortcuts, slash commands, configuration, theming,
MCP servers, skills, plugins, hooks, headless mode, sandboxing, and more.

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager-bin` | Composition-root package; builds the `xai-grok-pager` binary |
| `crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager` | The TUI: scrollback, prompt, modals, rendering |
| `crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell` | Agent runtime + leader/stdio/headless entry points |
| `crates/codegen/xai-grok-tools` | Tool implementations (terminal, file edit, search, ...) |
| `crates/codegen/xai-grok-workspace` | Host filesystem, VCS, execution, checkpoints |
| `crates/codegen/...` | The rest of the CLI crate closure (config, MCP, markdown, sandbox, ...) |
| `crates/common/`, `crates/build/`, `prod/mc/` | Small shared leaf crates pulled in by the closure |
| `third_party/` | Vendored upstream source (Mermaid diagram stack) — see below |
| `integrations/native-provider/` | In-progress subscription model transports and local OAuth service; not replacement agents |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The root `Cargo.toml` (workspace members, dependency versions, lints,
> profiles) is **generated** — treat it as read-only. Prefer editing per-crate
> `Cargo.toml` files.

## Development

```sh
cargo check -p <crate>        # always target specific crates; full-workspace builds are slow
cargo test -p xai-grok-config # per-crate tests
cargo clippy -p <crate>       # lint config: clippy.toml at the repo root
cargo fmt --all               # rustfmt.toml at the repo root
```
